/// This covers basic types and control flow.  This also jumps ahead to commonly used data structures

/// Recommended order:
///
/// numbers
/// strings
/// if_else
/// functions_and_tuples
/// expressions
/// enums
/// r#match
/// structs
/// struct_impl
/// option_and_result
/// option_and_result_conversions;
/// vectors
/// maps
/// sets
